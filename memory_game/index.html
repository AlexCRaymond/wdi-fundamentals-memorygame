	<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Although this is a pretty old game, it has stood the test of time and will still rock your socks off!  Okay maybe not but it's still a really fun game to play with your friends.  And hey, make it more interesting by betting them they can't match three in a row or THEY have to buy the pizza you just ordered.  Or the beer.  Whatever you want it's YOUR GAME! Have fun!</p>
